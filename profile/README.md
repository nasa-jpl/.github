Have you been awed by views of desolate Martian Valleys, swirling storms above Jupiter, and the icy blades ringing Saturn? Then you have journeyed with NASA JPL spacecraft and rovers.

Our missions have flown to every planet and the Sun in a quest to understand our place in the universe, and to search for the possibility of life beyond Earth.

Itâ€™s also a journey powered, in part, by open source developers from around the world.

Discover the universe of open source software at NASA JPL!
